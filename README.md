# OS Workshop: Command History Activity

## Overview
This repository is part of an Operating Systems workshop designed for hands-on exploration of kernel development using the xv6 operating system.

The core objective of this specific activity is to understand how an OS kernel manages console input, hardware interrupts, and device drivers by implementing a **Kernel-Level Command History** feature.

## Workshop Activity: Command History
Instead of implementing history at the shell level, we modified the kernel's console driver (`kernel/console.c`) to provide a persistent, low-level command buffer accessible across the entire system.

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Circular History Buffer:** Stores the last 10 commands directly in kernel memory.
- **Escape Sequence Handling:** A state machine within the console interrupt handler detects ANSI escape sequences for arrow keys.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Users can use the **Up Arrow** and **Down Arrow** keys to browse and edit previous commands.
- **Dynamic Line Buffering:** Real-time manipulation of the console's edit buffer to replace the current line with history entries.

### How to Run & Test:
1. **Build and Start:** Run `make qemu` to compile and launch the OS.
2. **Execute Commands:** Type a few commands like `ls`, `mkdir test`, and `echo hello`.
3. **Navigate History:** Press the **Up Arrow** to scroll back through your command history and the **Down Arrow** to scroll forward.
4. **Edit and Re-run:** You can edit any recalled command before pressing **Enter**.

# Original xv6 README
xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)).  See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
